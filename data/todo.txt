Use sound to skip through start beam onto ship
Transfer AI - Needs reworking - not choosing two into one because single legs are wrong color
Higher level droids will anticipate shot ( leading shot )

Find better way to handle action key when using a joystick
No keyboard arrow keys while joystick plugged in and not used
